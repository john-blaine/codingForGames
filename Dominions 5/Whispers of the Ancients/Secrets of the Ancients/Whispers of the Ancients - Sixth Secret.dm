Secret #6 Information: 'The Ancients have remembered the secrets of golem-crafting that our own race discovered. While our golemancers have all perished long ago, taking their knowledge with them, the long memories of the Pale Ones persist even in death and they now reveal that which was lost. The statues of the Pale Ones were all lost in the Great War, but sculptors still toil to this day to create them in the image of our own people. (“Attentive Statues” spell is useable)
